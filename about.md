My name is Michael Delva, and you are on my blog !

I'm a game developper working for [Fishing Cactus](http://www.fishingcactus.com), a belgian company. I'm mostly a gameplay programmer, but I also like writing shaders, and I have good skills in engine development, having participated a lot in the in-house engine by the past.

I love using [Unreal Engine 4](http://www.unrealengine.com), but I have good [Unity](http://www.unity3d.com) skills too.

Apart from reading and writing computer code, I do love doing sport, watching movies and TV shows, reading, and learning a lot.
